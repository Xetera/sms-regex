# SMS Regex

A database that allows extracting useful information found in automated SMS messages, like One Time Passwords (OTPs) or non-marketing data.

Currently only supports types of messages that are relevant for me, which is mainly SMS messages that Turkish companies like Trendyol. Feel free to PR new changes if it's useful to you.

Used by [sms-router](https://github.com/xetera/sms-router) for grabbing codes out of OTP messages.
